# Spawn Helper
[Spawn Helper](https://github.com/pricemi115/grumptech-spawn-helper), by [GrumpTech](https://github.com/pricemi115/), is an event-driven module allowing modules to spawn asynchronous tasks.
This module wraps the behaviors of the `child_process` module of NodeJS in an easy to use package.
Consumers simply need to create an instance of the SpawnHelper, register for the `complete` event, and invoke the Spawn() method.
Refer to the documentation by opening `./docs/index.html` in a web browser.
